# Welcome

Python-OBD is a library for handling data from a car's [**O**n-**B**oard **D**iagnostics port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) (OBD-II). It can stream real time sensor data, perform diagnostics (such as reading check-engine codes), and is fit for the Raspberry Pi. This library is designed to work with standard [ELM327 OBD-II adapters](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?field-keywords=elm327).

<span style="color:red">*NOTE: Python-OBD is below 1.0.0, meaning the API may change between minor versions. Consult the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/brendan-w/python-OBD/releases) for changelogs before updating.*</span>

# Installation

Install the latest release from pypi:

```shell
$ pip install obd
```

*Note: If you are using a Bluetooth adapter on Linux, you may also need to install and configure your Bluetooth stack. On Debian-based systems, this usually means installing the following packages:*

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez-utils blueman
```

# Basic Usage

```python
import obd

connection = obd.OBD() # auto-connects to USB or RF port

cmd = obd.commands.SPEED # select an OBD command (sensor)

response = connection.query(cmd) # send the command, and parse the response

print(response.value) # returns unit-bearing values thanks to Pint
print(response.value.to("mph")) # user-friendly unit conversions
```

OBD connections operate in a request-reply fashion. To retrieve data from the car, you must send commands that query for the data you want (e.g. RPM, Vehicle speed, etc). In python-OBD, this is done with the `query()` function. The commands themselves are represented as objects, and can be looked up by name or value in `obd.commands`. The `query()` function will return a response object with parsed data in its `value` property.

# Module Layout

```python
import obd

obd.OBD            # main OBD connection class
obd.Async          # asynchronous OBD connection class
obd.commands       # command tables
obd.Unit           # unit tables (a Pint UnitRegistry)
obd.OBDStatus      # enum for connection status
obd.scan_serial    # util function for manually scanning for OBD adapters
obd.OBDCommand     # class for making your own OBD Commands
obd.ECU            # enum for marking which ECU a command should listen to
obd.logger         # the OBD module's root logger (for debug)
```
